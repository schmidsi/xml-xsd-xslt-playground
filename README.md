xml-xsd-xslt-playground
=======================


This is a playground that I created for a project in my school to avoid writing xml by hand.

Here is the mighty feature list:
- Generates XML from Jade
- Validates generated XML against XML Schema
- Transformes generated XML to plain HTML with XSLT
- Small XML Database with Persons, Projects, Contributions to the projects
- Fancy XPath sum() and count() expressions
- Google Maps integration


See the result:
